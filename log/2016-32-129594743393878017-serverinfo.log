Welcome to the Trueshot Lodge Hunter Discord.

<#129594743393878017> may contain anything under and over the sun, and can be NSFW.
<#172447795729399808> is for Hunter-related theorycraft/chatting only.
<#129600026874871808> is for PvP.
<#209274922793435146> automatically announces when Twitch streams go online.
<#148848155159560193> is for guild recruitment, group recruitment and so on.
<#162574877386080256> for announcements and news that are relevant to the community. And sometimes not so relevant.


We do not have an active list of rules that we follow. We expect reasonable conduct from anyone in the Discord, and troublesome people will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

Above all, the goal of the Discord is to facilitate maximum Hunter class information. That is to say that the main goal here is to have as much good information "output"  as possible for the betterment of the community and Hunter players. <#172447795729399808> is where you'll see new information on the Hunter class and how to play it before it reaches guides, MMO-Champion, and so on.

For a Hunter forum, we recommend Jademcian's https://trueshotlodge.ca/forums/ - here you will also find new theorycraft as it is created, and as new info about Legion is released.

If you ask questions that could be answered by reading the guides that exist out there, people will usually not respond in kind. When answering especially simple questions, do your own research for a moment (usually by checking the currently relevant Hunter guides) before asking. "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.".

We strongly recommend using the Discord "Dark Theme".
