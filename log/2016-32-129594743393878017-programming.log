[2016-08-11 01:35:24] [Netherhunter]                     [ID: 202941448306294785] well its a melee spec
[2016-08-11 01:35:31] [Netherhunter]                     [ID: 202941448306294785] so thats already a huge downside
[2016-08-11 01:35:32] [Nyctaaz]                          [ID: 203288163203022858] Well there's still a difference between playing ranged and melee. As it is rn, BM wil never outscale MM

BM has the strong point of being a free-movement spec, and very simple rotation (have you ever played simon?), but that's all in favor of BM. also, as Netherhunter said, MM  requires only 22 points for the golden traits, BM 26

If you play at a casual or even casual-core level, you're probably ok with picking what you enjoy.  If the meter is what makes you happy, MM looks better until after the first raid at least.  Am I wrong?
