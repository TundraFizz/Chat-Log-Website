Preraid General/Agi DPS Trinket Sim List for SimCraft (mostly for theorycrafting use). (R) means ranged-only, (M) means melee-only, nothing means both and (?) means I have no fucking idea, as well as APL use entries.

Note that a fuckton of these trinkets just straight up aren't implemented, I've added NYI to those, but I might have missed some (especially the melee ones). Impact Tremor crashes SimCraft, so I disabled it for now.

Additionally, here's an MM Legion profile that is currently the base of my MM theorycraft for Legion, as always subject to change..: http://pastebin.com/EQ3eAJ1P
