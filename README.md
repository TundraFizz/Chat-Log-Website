### Introduction:
This is intended for use with [Discord Bot Chat Log](https://github.com/TundraFizz/dbot-chat-log).

### Todo:
 * Enable logging of edited posts
 * Replace @Mention ID numbers with their name
  * Example: Replace <@204383992944787456> with Tundra
 * Right now if you don't enter anything in for the server ID and submit, it will default to the server with the greatest ID
  * Change this so that it gives an error telling the user they must put an ID in
  * Also give an error if the server was not found in the directory
